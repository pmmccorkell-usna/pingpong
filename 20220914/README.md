# pingpong
 pingpong lab

In Development:
- Left off at developing controllers in code.py



Presently runs pingpong.tsd_profile_characteristics() at startup for testing purposes.
Test not completed; would be logged from teraterm and graphed in matlab to find correlation of:
- pwm_to_motor : adc_from_sensor.



Testing left off at discovering:
- 12V is too high; operational range is only 0.3 to 0.4 duty cycle (pwm).
- 6V is too low; cannot consistently cause the pingpong ball to levitate.

Next was to test @9V.
